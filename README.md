# studcoinfirsttoken
I have created my first token called "studcoin". Studcoin is special token which has given to certain student in an community for their contribution towards the community.           One can gift these token and based on the token we can to some "Solana" coins which fills their souls with the "SOL".

One Can Start the coding with these part running into your CLI or Terminal as:
We'll start with a new Solana client, head over to your Solana workspace and run this command:

npx create-solana-client [name] --initialize-keypair
cd [name]
npm i

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These dependecies must be added after running the above steps 
Here! We Will be adding the MetaplexSDk.
Start by adding the new dependencies:

npm install @metaplex-foundation/js fs
npm install @metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata
